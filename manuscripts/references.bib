	abstract = {Natural hazards like landslides, avalanches, floods and debris flows can result in enormous property damage and human casualties in mountainous regions. Switzerland has always been exposed to a wide variety of natural hazards mostly located in its alpine valleys. Recent natural disasters comprising avalanches, floods, debris flows and slope instabilities led to substantial loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure, cultural heritage and environment. In order to offer a solid technical infrastructure, a new concept and expert-tool based on an integrated web-based database/GIS structure is being developed under HazNETH. Given the HazNETH database design contemplates the detection and mapping of diagnostic features from remote sensors (e.g., ground, air and space borne) this paper analyses the use of remote sensing data in landslides studies during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including a discussion of its potential and research challenges as result of new operational and forthcoming technologies such as the very high spatial resolution optical and infrared imagery of Ikonos, Quickbird, IRS CartoSat-1, ALOS, the satellite based interferometric SAR (InSAR and DInSAR of Radarsat, ERS, Envisat, TerraSAR-X, Cosmo/ SkyMed, ALOS), micro-satellites like the Ple`iades, DMC, RapidEye, airborne LASER altimetry or ground-based differential interferometric SAR. The use of remote sensing data, whether air-, satellite- or ground-based varies according to three main stages of a landslide related study, namely a) detection and identification; b) monitoring; c) spatial analysis and hazard prediction. Accordingly, this paper presents and discusses previous applications of remote sensing tools as related to these three main phases, proposing a conceptual framework for the contribution of remote sensing to the design of databases for natural hazards like debris flows, and identifying areas for further research.},

	abstract = {Spatial patterns of sediment storage types and associated volumes using a novel approach for quantifying valley fill deposits are presented for a small alpine catchment (17 km2) in the Bavarian Alps. The different sediment storage types were analysed with respect to geomorphic coupling and sediment flux activity. The dominant landforms in the valley in terms of surface area were found to be talus slopes (sheets and cones) followed by rockfall deposits and alluvial fans and plains. More than two-thirds of the talus slopes are relict landforms, completely decoupled from the geomorphic system. Notable sediment transport is limited to avalanche tracks, debris flows, and along floodplains. Sediment volumes were calculated using a combination of polynomial functions of cross sections, seismic refraction, and GIS modelling. A total of, 66 seismic refraction profiles were carried out throughout the valley for a more precise determination of sediment thicknesses and to check the bedrock data generated from geomorphometric analysis. We calculated the overall sediment volume of the valley fill deposits to be 0.07 km3. This corresponds to a mean sediment thickness of 23.3 m. The seismic refraction data showed that large floodplains and sedimentation areas, which have been developed through damming effects from large rockfalls, are in general characterised by shallow sediment thicknesses ( {\textless} 20 m). By contrast, the thickness of several talus slopes is more than twice as much. For some locations (e.g., narrow sections of valley), the polynomial-generated cross sections resulted in overestimations of up to one order of magnitude; whereas in sections with a moderate valley shape, the modelled cross sections are in good accordance with the obtained seismic data. For the quantification of valley fill deposits, a combined application of bedrock data derived from polynomials and geophysical prospecting is highly recommended.},

	abstract = {Moisture-induced landslides are a global geohazard; mitigating the risk posed by landslides requires an understanding of the hydrological and geological conditions present within a given slope. Recently, numerous geophysical studies have been attempted to characterise slow-moving landslides, with an emphasis on developing geoelectrical methods as a hydrological monitoring tool. However, landslides pose specific challenges for processing geoelectrical data in long-term monitoring contexts as the sensor arrays can move with slope movements. Here we present an approach for processing long-term (over 8 years) geoelectrical monitoring data from an active slow-moving landslide, Hollin Hill, situated in Lias rocks in the southern Howardian Hills, UK. These slope movements distorted the initial setup of the monitoring array and need to be incorporated into a time-lapse resistivity processing workflow to avoid imaging artefacts. We retrospectively sourced seven digital terrain models to inform the topography of our imaging volumes, which were acquired by either Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based photogrammetry or terrestrial laser ranging systems. An irregular grid of wooden pegs was periodically surveyed with a global position system, from which distortions to the terrain model and electrode positions can be modelled with thin plate splines. In order to effectively model the time-series electrical resistivity images, a baseline constraint is applied within the inversion scheme; the result of the study is a time-lapse series of resistivity volumes which also incorporate slope movements. The workflow presented here should be adaptable for other studies focussed on geophysical/ geotechnical monitoring of unstable slopes.},

Displacement vectors of about 50 individual characteristic points have been determined; these clearly show the area of the sagging slope. From 1999 to 2004, eleven GPS campaigns have been carried out, yielding very accurate displacement vectors at four monitoring points.

To ensure the stability of slopes, it is necessary to accurately monitor the moisture content and understand the complex interactions between soil, water, and slope behavior. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of advanced soil moisture detection techniques for unsaturated soil slopes, including point-scale measurements and geophysical methods. It first introduces the fundamental concepts of the soil–water characteristic curve (SWCC) and its influence on the shear strength and stability of unsaturated soil slopes. It then delves into the working principles and applications of various point-scale measurement techniques, such as time-domain reflectometry (TDR), frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR), and neutron probe methods. Additionally, this paper explores the use of geophysiDear Editor: The author has checked that the name and affiliation are accuratecal methods, including ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and electromagnetic induction (EMI), for the non-invasive assessment of soil moisture conditions and slope stability monitoring. This review highlights the advantages of integrating multiple geophysical techniques, combined with traditional geotechnical and hydrological measurements, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface conditions and their influence on slope stability. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the successful application of this integrated approach in various slope monitoring scenarios. The continued advancement in these areas will contribute to the development of more accurate, reliable, and widely adopted solutions for the assessment and management of slope stability risks.},

These landscape features have been recognised as locations of substantial deep drainage losses, and are therefore target areas for water use efficiency. Electromagnetic induction (EM) measurements were used to identify the width and the depth of the palæochannel sediments in a 2-dimensional transect. Three different inversion techniques, Tikhonov regularisation, the McNeill layered earth model, and an optimal linear combination of EM measurements, were applied to a combination of EM-38 and EM-34 data. Using various kriging techniques, the resulting conductivity profiles were interpolated to soil property data and transformed to saturated hydraulic conductivities using pedotransfer functions. There were distinct differences in the resulting stratigraphies depending on the inversion and interpolation method employed. Trend kriging of the sampled soil property data using the Cook and Walker and Tikhonov inversion data as a trend surface gave the most consistent hydraulic conductivity values compared to the sampled soil property data. However, differences between inversion and interpolation methods were negated by uncertainties in the pedotransfer functions.},

A new model, termed “BQART” in recognition of those factors, accounts for these varied inﬂuences. When applied to a database of 488 rivers, the BQART model showed no ensemble over- or underprediction, had a bias of just 3\% across six orders of magnitude in observational values, and accounted for 96\% of the between-river variation in the long-term ("30 years) sediment load or yield of these rivers. The geographical range of the 488 rivers covers 63\% of the global land surface and is highly representative of global geology, climate, and socioeconomic conditions. Based strictly on geological parameters (basin area, relief, lithology, ice erosion), 65\% of the between-river sediment load is explained. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) account for an additional 14\% of the variability in global patterns in load. Anthropogenic factors account for an additional 16\% of the between-river loads, although with ever more dams being constructed or decommissioned and socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure in ﬂux, this contribution is temporally variable. The glacial factor currently contributes only 1\% of the signal represented by our globally distributed database, but it would be much more important during and just after major glaciations. The BQART model makes possible the quantiﬁcation of the inﬂuencing factors (e.g., climate, basin area, ice cover) within individual basins, to better interpret the terrestrial signal in marine sedimentary records. The BQART model predicts the long-term ﬂux of sediment delivered by rivers; it does not predict the episodicity (e.g., typhoons, earthquakes) of this delivery.},

The soil depth model solves for the mass balance between soil production from underlying bedrock and the divergence of diffusive soil transport. This model is applied using high-resolution digital elevation data of a well-studied site in northern California and the evolving soil depth is solved using a finite difference model under varying initial conditions. The field data support an exponential decline of soil production with increasing soil depth and a diffusivity of about 50 cm2/ yr. The predicted pattern of thick and thin colluvium corresponds well with field observations. Soil thickness on ridges rapidly obtain an equilibrium depth, which suggests that detailed field observations relating soil depth to local topographic curvature could further test this model. Bedrock emerges where the curvature causes divergent transport to exceed the soil production rate, hence the spatial pattern of bedrock outcrops places constraints on the production law. The infinite slope stability model uses the predicted soil depth to estimate the effects of root cohesion and vertically varying saturated conductivity. Low cohesion soils overlying low conductivity bedrock are shown to be least stable. The model may be most useful in analyses of slope instability associated with vegetation changes from either land use or climate change, although practical applications may be limited by the need to assign values to several spatially varying parameters. Although both the soil depth and slope stability models offer local mechanistic predictions that can be applied to large areas, representation of the finest scale valleys in the digital terrain model significantly influences local model predictions. This argues for preserving fine-scale topographic detail and using relatively fine grid sizes even in analyses of large catchments.},
